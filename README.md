 [MedicineCabinet](https://student.agh.edu.pl/~telesins/Apteczka/index.php) is a web application that helps you manage the medicines we have at home. First Aid Kit is a web application that helps you manage the medicines we have at home. You can create a new first aid kit or add yourself to an existing one. It includes functionalities such as displaying contents, consumption, disposal, operation history and cost report. In the following I will try to describe its operation in more detail. 
 
 The project was carried out as part of a course credit at university, therefore the code is in Polish. 
 The project is the result of collaboration with [@chikorita](https://github.com/chickorita).
